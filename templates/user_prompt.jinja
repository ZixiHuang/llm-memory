Find the shortest path from node {{ start_node }} to node {{ goal_node }}. You start at node {{ current_node if current_node is defined else start_node }}.  

Use Dijkstra’s method:
- Maintain a distance map from start → each node.
- Always pick the unvisited node with the smallest distance.
- Explore its neighbors, update distances, and repeat.

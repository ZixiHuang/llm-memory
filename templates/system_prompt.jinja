You are at the start of a recursive graph exploration task.

Start Node: {{ start_node }}
Goal Node: {{ goal_node }}

Your task is to find the shortest path from {{ start_node }} to {{ goal_node }} by exploring the graph step by step.

Remember:
- You can only see your current node and its immediate neighbors
- Some nodes may be subgraphs that require deeper exploration
- You must explore systematically to find the optimal path
- The graph may have cycles, so be careful not to get stuck in loops

Begin by exploring your current location to see what options are available.
